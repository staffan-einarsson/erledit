erledit
	An interactive code editor for erlang.

Purpose
	* To have an integrated development environment for erlang, that makes it easier to develop erlang systems than the emacs + terminal setup.
	* To act as an example on how a desktop application can be designed using erlang.

Features
	* An editor that works with the code within the erlang VM, making it environment-aware. This will provide better syntax highlighting and completion.
	* Internal supervision structure makes the application fault tolerant and separates data from presentation.
	* A shell within the editor that can be used like the erl shell, possibly with some extra functions specific to the editor.
	* Extensibility by updating the editor modules while it still runs.
