erledit
	An interactive code editor for erlang.

Purpose
	* To have an integrated development environment for erlang, that makes it easier to develop erlang systems than the emacs + terminal setup.
	* To act as an example on how a desktop application can be designed using erlang.

Features
	* An editor that works with the code within the erlang VM, making it environment-aware. This will provide better syntax highlighting and completion.
	* Internal supervision structure makes the application fault tolerant and separates data from presentation.
	* A shell within the editor that can be used like the erl shell, possibly with some extra functions specific to the editor.
	* Extensibility by updating the editor modules while it still runs.

Architecture
	document_sup
		data_buffer
			Holds the current data buffer and responds to messages from the gui. Spawns data_mod processes when a modification should be made on the data.
		data_mod
			A one-shot process that performs a given modification on a supplied set of data. Then sends the modified data back to the owner.
		gui
			User front-end that sends messages to the data_buffer when a modification should be made. It also receives updates from the data_buffer about its current state.
